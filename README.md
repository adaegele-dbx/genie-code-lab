# Hands-On with Genie Code

A ~55-minute hands-on lab for learning **Genie Code** — Databricks' agentic
AI assistant — by using it to build a working analytics stack on top of an
IoT energy meter dataset.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this lab you will have used Genie Code to:

- **Seed and explore** four Unity Catalog tables in a small star schema:
  `regions`, `business_units`, `sites`, `meter_readings`
- **Build & run a Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipeline** that produces a
  daily per-site gold table with an anomaly flag
- **Stand up a Genie space** over the gold table for natural-language Q&A
- **Deploy a Databricks App** (Streamlit) that lists anomalous sites with
  a date filter
- **Customize Genie Code** three ways: with `.assistant_instructions.md`
  (custom instructions), a `SKILL.md` agent skill, and a Managed Genie MCP
  server pointed at the space you just built — see how each one changes
  what Genie Code can do

The scenario throughout: you're on the energy operations team of an
industrial company that owns 10 sites across the US.

## Prerequisites

- A Databricks workspace (Free Edition works)
- Unity Catalog enabled (default on all workspaces)
- A SQL warehouse running (Free Edition's 2X-Small is enough)
- Free Edition users: ensure no other Databricks App is currently running
  (Free Edition allows one)

> ⚠️ **Free Edition quota:** Free Edition workspaces have a small daily
> compute quota that the SDP pipeline run (Part 3a), Genie space queries, and
> the deployed app all consume. **It is likely that you will run out of
> quota** before the end of the lab, especially if you re-run the pipeline
> several times. If everything stops responding mid-lab, that's almost
> certainly why — pick up the rest after quota resets (typically the next
> day).

> 🛑 **Run Genie Code conversations OUTSIDE the lab notebook.** Every Genie
> Code prompt in this lab should be entered from a thread that is not
> anchored to `lab_notebook.py`. Open the Genie Code panel from the workspace
> home, a fresh untitled notebook, or the SQL editor. Otherwise Agent mode
> can add cells *into the lab notebook itself* while performing tasks like
> EDA — making the lab harder to re-run.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone this repo as a Git Folder in your Databricks workspace

1. In your Databricks workspace, go to **Workspace** in the left sidebar
2. Click **Create** → **Git folder**
3. Paste this repository's URL
4. Click **Create Git folder**

### 2. Open the lab notebook

Navigate to `lab_notebook.py` in the cloned folder and open it. All lab
instructions are inside.
